6502golf
=========================
6502 code golf machine (inspired by mokehehe's z80golf)
Useful for getting to grips with 6502 first, before
coding in 6502 for another system (like Commodore
64, VIC-20, NES, ...)

BUILDING
========================
Very unfortunately, I cannot provide binaries for
you right now, but building 6502golf is easy and
requires no other dependencies. All you need are:
- a C compiler (preferably gcc)
- make (to make the Makefile, duh)
To build 6502golf, cd to the src directory and
simply type "make". (should work on all *NIX systems)
For Windows, you could try building it using MinGW.
I haven't got it quite figured out for Windows,
yet so if anyone has any more ideas, please send
me a pull request.

SPECIFICATIONS
========================
- 6502golf supports NMOS 6502.
+ You can use CMOS 65C02 but you'll have to fiddle
  with the Makefile to get it to build.
  Change NMOS6502 to CMOS6502 in the Makefile.
- If no binary is provided, a simple embedded test
  ROM will be run that prints: "6502GOLF TEST ROM".
- If a binary is provided, it will be loaded at the
  load address specified by the first 2 bytes of the
  binary.
- Program execution will start at PC=$0200. 
  (no exceptions)
- If a byte is written into $00, whatever was
  written there will be output to stdout.
- If a byte is read from $01, a character will be
  read from stdin. 
- Memory from $0002 to $FFE0 is left free for the
  user to use.
- $FFE0 to $FFFF is reserved for system purposes.
  You can use this range, however your program
  may break in future updates.
